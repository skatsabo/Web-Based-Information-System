		<p>Welcome to the Department of Computer Science and Biomedical Informatics.The Department of Computer Science and Biomedical Informatics was founded in the 	academic year   2004-2005. It is a pioneer Department in the field of Applied Sciences because it covers a wide range, both in the field of Information Technology and in Biomedicine. The Department provides students with knowledge on Computer Science along with specialization, which includes the use of Information Systems in the field of medical technology and research in Biomedical Engineering and Bioinformatics.
		</p>
		<p>Computer applications in the field of Health Services now constitute in all developed countries one of the major areas of software development for large clinics. Our country is generally lagging behind in this area - compared with other European countries - and as it seems there is already the need for specialized scientists, in the context of the overall modernization of the health care system.
		</p>
		<p>The Department of Computer Science and Biomedical Informatics is a Department that is dynamically growing having remarkable distribution of high-impact scientific publications, graduates with international distinctions and postgraduate studies at Universities both in foreign universities and in Greece and also an award-winning IEEE Student Branch since 2011.
		</p>
		<p>We hope that our website will be useful to you as it has been created primarily to give information on undergraduate studies to prospective students, information about academic issues to our current students and general information for the casual visitor.
